** What are PIC chips?
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: research
:END:
Peripheral Interface Controllers are small silicon chips which can be programmed to perform useful tasks.
In school, we tend to use Genie branded chips, like the C08 model you will use in this project. Others (e.g. PICAXE) are available.
PIC chips allow you connect different inputs (e.g. switches) and outputs (e.g. LEDs, motors and speakers), and to control them using flowcharts.
Chips such as these can be found everywhere in consumer electronic products, from toasters to cars. 

While they might not look like much, there is more computational power in a single PIC chip used in school than there was in the space shuttle that went to the moon in the 60's!
** When would I use a PIC chip?
Imagine you wanted to make a flashing bike light; using an LED and a switch alone, you'd need to manually push and release the button to get the flashing effect. A PIC chip could be programmed to turn the LED off and on once a second.
In a board game, you might want to have an electronic dice to roll numbers from 1 to 6 for you. 
In a car, a circuit is needed to ensure that the airbags only deploy when there is a sudden change in speed, AND the passenger is wearing their seatbelt, AND the front or rear bumper has been struck. PIC chips can carry out their instructions very quickly, performing around 1000 instructions per second - as such, they can react far more quickly than a person can. 
* Introduction

- There are many ways to go about fabricating an electromechanical system. It is useful to know a variety of methods for working with resistant materials. 
- The different techniques that can be employed to make a new part or product can be broadly broken up as:
  - *Addition/Fabrication.* Material/parts added. E.g. 3D printing complex forms with molten ABS, gluing one piece of wood to another or bolting one engine part to another.
  - *Wastage.* Material is removed. E.g. Drilling a hole in a block of steel or filing a corner off a wooden block. 
  - *Redistribution* Changing the shape of a material. E.g. Injection moulding to make toy parts, or melting pewter in a crucible and pouring it into a mould (casting). 
  - [[https://www.doitpoms.ac.uk/tlplib/metal-forming-2/printall.php][*Deformation.*]] Changing a material's shape. E.g. Vacuum forming, using a pipe-bender to create a right-angle in a copper gas pipe or beating a horse-shoe into shape with a hammer. 

** Industrial Processes
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Understanding of how familiar processes used in school are related to those used in the industrial context, especially with reference to batch and mass production.
    - *[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sand_casting][Sand casting]]:* A mould is formed from sand, and molten metal is poured into it to form the desired part. A low-cost method of forming metal parts with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
    - *[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Die_casting][Die casting]]:* Forming metal parts by forcing molten metal into a mould. Better precision than sand casting, but unsuitable for high-volume manufacture.
    - *[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_forming][Vacuum Forming]]:* A method of working with thermoplastics, whereby a softened plastic sheet is stretched over a mould, and a vacuum pump is used to ensure the plastic sheet tightly follows the conours of the mould. 
    - *PCB production:* The method is discussed in the GCSE notes, [[https://www.bournetoinvent.com/projects/gcse_theory/11.html][here]]. 
** Wastage
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- For the exam, you need to know several hand and machine methods of shaping commonly available resistant materials by wastage. A wastage process is one where you start with a block of material (e.g. wood), and use tools to take away the parts you don't want /(e.g. drill, saw)/ to get the the overall shape is desired. 

- *Hand methods*
     1. A coping saw can be used where a curved or intricate line needs to be cut,
     2. A panel saw can be used to cut larger pieces of timber,
     3. A drill can be used to make circular holes.
     4. A chisel can be used to precisely remove areas of a material.

- *Machine methods*
    1. A bandsaw will cut quickly through most woods at high speed, and can be used to cut curves – this requires training and a great deal of care.
    2. A circular saw can be used to quickly cut through or to cut grooves in straight lines at high speed.
    3. A belt-sander can be used to remove rough edges, smoothing out the workpiece.

- *CAM methods*
     1. A CNC router can be programmed (using 3d software) to carve the desired shape from a block of wood. The wood to be cut needs to be firmly secured to the bed of the machine, to ensure the work piece isn’t dislodged by the high-speed cutting bits. 
     2. A laser-cutter cuts shapes from sheet material using a tightly focused beam to cut through (and etch) thermoplastic materials. A design is created on a CAD package on the computer, then sent to the machine where it is cut. Extractor is turned on throughout and the user needs to avoid eye contact with the beam. 
     3. A CNC lathe can cut into lengths of wood and metal to produce shapes as required. Often used for table legs, or for precisely maching parts for engines and machinery. 

** Fabrication Methods
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Mechanical methods which work on a variety of materials are:
    - Machine screws (bolts) can be used with washers (to spread the load and help prevent breakage). Two surfaces are drilled slowly, then bolted. If requried, nylon-lined (nyloc) nuts can be used, which won't slip loose over time. 
    - A CNC milling machine or router can be used in a similar way to a laser cutter, but to use a physical bit to cut away at the surface of the material. Careful work with a small chisel and hammer can be used to square off any corners where needed.
- Temporary fabrication techniques suitable for wood, metal and plastic. A minimum of three mechanical methods
- Redistribution /Deformation
   - Redistribution methods are where a material is melted or formed into a new shape, eliminating waste. Injection moulding, for instance.
   - Deformation is where a material's shape is changed by being manipulated. This could be a piece of metal being beaten into shape (e.g. a horsehoe), sheet steel being rolled through the 3-in-1 machine or aluminium sheet being folded by being clamped in a vice and struck. 
** Woods
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Permanent fabrication techniques suitable for *wood* are those which allow different pieces of wood to be permentantly joined together.
    - *Mechanical methods* like self-tapping wood screws can be used to permanently join two pieces of wood together. A countersink can be used to ensure the screws finish flush with /(or beneath)/ the surface. 
    - *Chemical methods* like PVA glue can be used to bond two wooden surfaces together. To ensure the strongest possible bond, the joints need to be close-fitting, and free from grease and dust. The glue is applied, before the two surfaces are clamped together. The bond will be better if the surface areas of the joints are increased (e.g. through the use of finger or dovetail joints).

** Metals
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Permanent fabrication techniques suitable for *metal*
    - *Thermal methods* such as soldering allows two metals to bond together, and is commonly used to connect electronic  components to PCBs and to connect copper pipes together in household plumbing installations. 
    - Another thermal method is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_welding][arc welding]], where an electric arc is formed between an electrode the material to be welded, to bond metals together. 
    - *Mechanical methods* such as nuts and bolts can be used to tightly attach two surfaces together, in a way which can be removed easily for when maintenance is required. 
    - Another mechanical method for metal is the use of *taps and dies*. The tap is first sued to sink a threaded hole into one surface, and the die is then used to cut a thread onto a cylindrical rod, so that the two can be screwed together. 

** Plastics
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: learn
:END:
- Permanent fabrication techniques suitable for *plastic* can include...
    - *Thermal methods* like line bending. This allows plastics to be heated, and bent along a focused point. The area to be worked is heated until soft, and then bent into the desired position. It is held in place until it cools and sets into its new shape.
    - *Vacuum forming* is another thermal method, where a mould is formed for the part which is needed. A sheet of material (e.g. HIPS, ABS or acrylic) is heated evenly until it softens. Once soft, the mould is pushed into the plastic, and a vacuum pump turned on to pull the plastic tightly onto the mould.
- Chemical methods
    - Plastic cement /(Tensol)/ can be used to bond two plastics. The joints need to be close-fitting, and free from grease/residue. The two surfaces are clamped together, and the solvent is applied sparingly. The glue is sucked into the joint through a capillary action. The bond will be better if the surface areas of the joins are increased (e.g. through the use of finger joints).
